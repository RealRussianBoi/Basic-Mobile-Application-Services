# Basic-Mobile-Application-Services
Three services created for a mobile application without a GUI, commissioned to me by Grand Strand Systems. 

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I created several JUnit files containing unit tests, all of which ensure proper program functionality by testing both boundary and edge cases, meaning they test for correct and incorrect inputs. 
The coverage rate is higher than 80%, ensuring proper quality. 

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpreted user needs by creating a user-input friendly program, which can easily be navigated by inputting numbers to call specific methods. I also created basic input validation, which prevents incorrect data from being inserted.
   
3. How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by placing myself in the shoes of the user and imagining how it would be easier or better for them to make use of my program, creating it in a way that would best suit them. 
For every section of the program I create, I test it all anew, ensuring that the methods all work properly in unison.
